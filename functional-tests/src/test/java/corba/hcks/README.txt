                hcks = Harold Carr's Kitchen Sink



This test exercises many of the invoke/dispatch paths in the ORB.



It is set up to easily step through everything AND to automatically
test those same paths.



NOTE: Please DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING IN THIS TEST WITHOUT FIRST
             CONFERRING WITH HAROLD if possible.



Thanks,
Harold Carr
