<h1>IO Prototype</h1>
<ul><li><h2>I once did a prototype of what could happen if the java.io group developed a relatively easy to extend template method system for going through the serialization protocol, separating the writing from the process.</h2></li>
<li><h2>This will now live in rip-int temporarily in docs/eea1/ioprototype.</h2></li>
<li><h2>While java.io agreed it would be nice, it would hurt their performance and they have no resources (Mike Warres is the only one who could do this work, and he's too busy.)</h2></li>
