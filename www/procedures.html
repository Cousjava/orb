<h2>Procedures</h2>
<p>There is a set procedure that must always be followed for CORBA development.  This will evolve
as the GlassFish-CORBA project evolves, so this is simply a first cut at defining the current 
development model.  Not: this is quite out of date, and needs some updates.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Discuss the idea for a change to the project on the dev@glassfish-corba.dev.java.net alias.
Make sure to give enough detail that others on the alias can reasonably understand what needs
to be changed, why the change is needed, and roughly what code will be changed.</li>
<li>Decide what new tests (if any) need to be written for the change.  In the case of a
bug, a new test is always required.  For a bug, the test must fail without the fix,
and pass with the fix. Any new tests must be integrated into the existing CORBA test framework.
Junit or TestNG can also be used, but they require a simple wrapper to integrate with the
test framework.</li>
<li>Make the modifications using whatever tools you like.  Some of us use emacs or vim,
others use NetBeans, but any choice could be made here.</li>
<li>Run all of the ORB tests (ant test) and make sure that they all pass.  No modifications
will be accepted that cause existing tests to fail.</li>
<li>Prepare a collection of all differences in modified files.  We used to use a Sun 
internal tool called webrev that did this for a TeamWare workspace.  Now that we are
using CVS, a different tool will be required.  As of this writing, I don't have any
specific tool recommendations here, but that will change over time.</li>
<li>Get the changes reviewed by at least one other team member.  We usually prefer to
do this using a telephone call and a shared VNC session, but that may not always be 
possible.  If necessary, a review could be conducted by email.</li>
<li>Finally, commit the changes to the CVS repository.  This is the usual CVS
repository on java.net at cvs.dev.java.net.  Everything in this project is in
the glassfish-corba module.</li>
