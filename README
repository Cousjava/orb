How to build ORB .jars for delivery to GlassFish:

---------------------------------------
# to build and run all tests:
cd <ws>
mvn -P all-tests clean install
#
# (temporarily broken) Run dev tests with code coverage enabled. 
# Cobertura code coverage report generated at: <ws>/build/cobertura/index.html
ant do-cobertura-test
#
--------------------------------------- 
# to run a single test with custom arguments:
cd <ws>
mvn -Dtest.args="<args supported by test framework>" install

For example: 
1. To run a specific test: 
mvn -Dtest.args="-test corba.connectioncache.ConnectionCacheTest" install

2. To debug a test, client process: 
mvn -Dtest.args="-test corba.connectioncache.ConnectionCacheTest -rdebug client" install

In the debug mode, the test waits for remote debugger to connect on the port, printed on console. The test continues once the remote debugger connects.

3. To debug a test, server process: 
mvn -Dtest.args="-test corba.cdrext.CDRExtTest -rdebug server" install

4. Multiple remote debuggers may also be attached to client, server, and controller processes (this is not well tested):
mvn -Dtest.args=""-test corba.sometest -rdebug client:server:controller" install
