// PCOSNamingTest is a bit tricky to debug.  It runs as follows:
// 1. The test driver starts ORBD and the server, and creates the controller
//    for the client.  The controllers for the client and ORBD are passed to
//    the server as arguments.
// 2. The server runs as an InternalProcess, but the -separateprocess flag
//    causes it to be execed in a different process.  There is currently no
//    debugging support for -separateprocess.
// 3. The server starts and stops ORBD 3 times, and then at the end it starts
//    the client.
// 
// To debug this test:
// 1. Remove the -separateprocess flag.
// 2. setenv DEBUGGER 1.  This allows attaching a debugger to the test driver,
//    which also runs the server directly.
// 3. -rdebug can be used as usual for client and ORBD as needed.  Note that 
//    the persistent name service is part of ORBD.
