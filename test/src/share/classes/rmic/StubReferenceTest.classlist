# List of classes for which StubReferenceTest will generate stubs/ties
# and compare them (ignoring whitespace) to a reference file.
#
# Entries are in the following form:
#
#    <inputclass> = <outputclass> [,<outputclass>]...[,<outputclass>]
#
# For each output class listed, a reference file
# must exist which ends with the ".javaref" extension.
#
# To assert that an inputclass should FAIL to compile, use
# the following format:
#
#    <inputclass> = ERROR [,<errorString>]...[<errorString>]
#
# where <errorString> is a string that must be found in the
# error output.
