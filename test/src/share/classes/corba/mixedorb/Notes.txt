Notes on a mixed ORB test

se ORB = ORB in JDK (5 or later)
ee ORB = ORB in app server (rip-int-generic)

goal: test use of se ORB with ee RMI-IIOP delegates.

approach:

    - Use JNDI for all name server access
    - Create client and server ORBs
        client: ee RMI-IIOP delegates se ORB impl (from JDK)
        server: ee RMI-IIOP delegates and ORB impl (from workspace)
    - Use explicit ORBs passed to 2 JNDI InitialContext instances
    - data
        ORB[] orbs ; // 0 is se, 1 is ee
        InitialContext[] ics ; // ics[i] uses orb[i]
            
    public interface Echo extends Remote {
        Echo echo( Echo obj ) throw RemoteException ;
    }

    public class EchoImpl extends PortableRemoteObject implements Echo {
        public Echo echo( Echo echo ) {
            return echo ;
        }
    }

    public class <T> NarrowHelper {
        private NarrowHelper() {}

        public static T narrow( Remote obj, Class<T> cls ) {
            return cls.cast( PortableRemoteObject.narrow(
                obj, cls ) ) ;
        }
    }

    import static NarrowHelper.narrow ;

    - test
        - client
            Echo myEcho = new EchoImpl() ;
            // put client's ORB in env
            InitialContext ic = new InitialContext( env ) ;
            Echo ec = narrow( ic.lookup( "name" ), Echo.class ) ; 
            Echo result = ec.echo( myEcho ) ;
            result.echo( ec ) ;

        - server
            - creates JNDI init context bound to server ORB
            - creates an instance of echo
            - registers it with JNDI
