Testing load balancing
    Test:
        Multiple client invoking against multiple servers, each gives
            equal distribution with PRLB
        server fails, clients continue with equal distr.
        server added, client continue with equal distr.

interface

public interface PRLBTest extends Remote {
    int myId() ;

    void invoke( int clientId ) ;

    Map<Integer,Integer> getAndClearCounts() ;

    shutdown() ;
}

2 clients, 3-5 servers

Each client, server has a unique id of the form (instance num, incarnation num)

Each client:
    invokes a simple ping() method repeatedly (possibly with a wait time?)
    may be configured to make:w
    some number of invocations, then cause server to shutdown
    configured with an identity

Each server:
    configured with identity
    controlled by clients
    each uses identical code to configure remote object
